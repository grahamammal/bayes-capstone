Such an excellent start!! Here are some things to start cleaning up: 1. Finalize your methodology section. This is currently a little tough to navigate. There are little things that can help: (a) Don't include so much in-line notation (this is tough to read); (b) use standard Bayesian model notation (layers of lines instead of in-line notation, the latter of which is really hard to follow); (c) provide more detail on the notation (eg: what does your M prior actually mean? what about the priors for the parameters? what's beta_w?); (d) be consistent with notation (what's \Omega and where do you use it?). There are also bigger things -- you should provide more detail on the priors, notation, etc. 2. Finalize your applications. Though it's awesome to have 3 examples if they each show a different aspect of the methodology, it's better to really polish 1 of the applications instead of having 3 less polished applications (this is really just up to you and how much time you plan to spend on this). Each application should provide background on the analysis, include data visualizations, and include a complete discussion of the results. 3. Compare your BMA results to those in which you use more traditional methods. 4. You can start shaping this up in a stylized final report form. For example, you might utilize code folding features for Rmd to show / hide the code so that readers can focus on the results: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#code-folding. Also use `refresh = FALSE` with rstanarm code so that your doc isn't overwhelmed by simulation updates.
