```

Plotting the top 10 candies by win percentage
```{r}
candy %>%
  head(20) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(y = reorder(competitorname, winpercent), x = winpercent)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Percent of Head to Heads Won", y = NULL, title = "Top 20 Candies") 
```

Plot how many candies are each type
```{r}
candy %>% 
  summarise_if(is.logical, sum) %>% 
  pivot_longer(1:ncol(.), names_to = "type", values_to = "count") %>%
  mutate(type_clean = c("Chocolate", "Fruity", "Caramel", "Peanuty or Almondy", "Nougat", "Crisped Rice Wafer", "Hard", "Bar", "Several Candies in One Bag")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = reorder(type_clean, count), x = count)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(y = NULL, x = NULL, title = "Number of Candies with each Attribute")
```

Plot win percent by cost
```{r}
candy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pricepercent, y = winpercent)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Relative Price", y = "Percent of Head to Heads Won", title = "Price versus Win Rate")
```

Plot win percent by sugar
```{r}
candy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sugarpercent, y = winpercent)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Sugar Content (Percent)", y = "Percent of Head to Heads Won", title = "Sugar Content versus Win Rate") +
  ylim(0, 100)
```

Win percent for each candy type

```{r}
candy %>% 
  select(winpercent, 2:10) %>%
  pivot_longer(2:10, names_to = "type", values_to = "is_type") %>% 
  filter(is_type) %>% 
  select(-is_type) %>% 
  group_by(type) %>% 
  mutate(mean_win = mean(winpercent)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = winpercent, y = reorder(type, mean_win), height = stat(density))) + 
  geom_density_ridges(stat = "binline", bins = 20, scale = 0.95, draw_baseline = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Percent of Head to Heads Won", y = NULL, title = "Candy Type by Win Percent") + 
  scale_y_discrete(labels = rev(c("Crisped Rice Wafer", "Peanuty or Almondy", "Bar", "Chocolate", "Nougat", "Caramel", "Several Candies in One Bag", "Fruity", "Hard")))
```

Fit the models

```{r}
set.seed(454)

model_1 <- stan_glm(winpercent ~ sugarpercent, 
                data = candy,
                family = gaussian, 
                chains = 4, iter = 2*5000, refresh = FALSE)

model_2 <- stan_glm(winpercent ~ sugarpercent + pricepercent, 
                data = candy,
                family = gaussian, 
                chains = 4, iter = 2*5000, refresh = FALSE)

model_3 <- stan_glm(winpercent ~ chocolate + fruity + caramel + peanutyalmondy + nougat + crispedricewafer + hard + bar + pluribus, 
                data = candy,
                family = gaussian, 
                chains = 4, iter = 2*5000, refresh = FALSE)

model_4 <- stan_glm(winpercent ~ chocolate + fruity + caramel + peanutyalmondy + nougat + crispedricewafer + hard + bar + pluribus + sugarpercent + pricepercent, 
                data = candy,
                family = gaussian, 
                chains = 4, iter = 2*5000, refresh = FALSE)
```


Calculate Leave One Out expected log point predictive densities
```{r}
"Model 1 Loo"
(loo_1 <- loo(model_1))$estimates
"Model 2 Loo"
(loo_2 <- loo(model_2))$estimates
"Model 3 Loo"
(loo_3 <- loo(model_3))$estimates
"Model 4 Loo"
(loo_4 <- loo(model_4))$estimates



lpd_point <- cbind(
  loo_1$pointwise[,"elpd_loo"], 
  loo_2$pointwise[,"elpd_loo"],
  loo_3$pointwise[,"elpd_loo"],
  loo_4$pointwise[,"elpd_loo"]
)
```

Find Pseudo-BMA+ weights

```{r}
(weights <- pseudobma_weights(lpd_point))
```
